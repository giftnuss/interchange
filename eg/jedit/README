At some point, I updated the JEdit file that was found on the
icdevgroup website so that jedit will properly syntax highlight CSS,
HTML, and Javascript. It now also properly handles heredocs (makes
working with usertags better).

I had to modify the html.xml definition due to issues of sticking an
IC tag in the middle of some html attribute. ie
  <img src="[image-src]" alt="[image-alt]" />
jedit refused to highlight these tags, the modification to html.xml is
simply an addition of a delegation to interchange.xml to handle such
tags

I attached the three modified files to this email, let me know if you
can't download them, I'll post them somewhere public.
