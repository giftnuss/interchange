                  What's new in each version of Interchange
                (in development since the version 5.6 branch)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See UPGRADE document for a list of incompatible changes.


Interchange 5.7.2 not yet released.

Core
----

* Fix validate_charset to return mime charset names only.

* Enabled catalog usertags within dispatch routines.

* SpecialSub order_missing added (#221).

* Made TAX_CATEGORY_FIELD work as intended, where a colon-separated
  table and field will work as well as a simple field in the same table
  as the item.

* Add environment variable MINIVEND_DISABLE_UTF8 which allows us to
  skip the Encode module entirely.

  Since "no encoding" does not remove the tie from regexes to Encode,
  but only disables it, you can't use that method. You have to literally
  not include Encode in the module namespace. This environment variable
  prevents require/import of the module if it is set true.

  It also adds a Global UTF8 directive that would normally not be, but could
  be, set by the user. This disables UTF8 with "no encoding", which should avoid
  some of the Perl UTF8 insanity but still won't avoid a potential "require" or
  "dofile" on a simple regex.

* Change Vend::CharSet away from the quasi-object style of programming
  (i.e. Module->routine()), since this module is only used internally.
  This will improve performance if/when a large number of CGI parameters
  are passed.

* Pass data to be encoded by Vend::CharSet by reference. While the
  Encode module inexplicably won't operate on references, at least we
  can avoid slinging hundred-megabyte files by value for what ends up
  being a no-op. Should you have to decode the data, it will still be
  slow but it will be limited to that eventuality, not every uploaded
  file.

* Fixed rare bug that caused requests to / URL with a query string to fail, e.g.:

  http://hostname/?somevar=1

  Interchange in that case looked for a page called "/?somevar=1".

  Thanks to David Christensen <david@endpoint.com> for the fix.

* Add new SessionCookieSecure boolean catalog directive. When enabled, makes
  session cookie set in https usable only in https.

* Add reload of AutoModifier based on a prepended ! (exclamation point).
  Example:
     
     AutoModifier    !download  pricing:price_group

  The download attribute will be recomputed for the current sku when
  the cart is recalculated.

* Add ability to merge user logins with merged_user field. When the
  user logs in, their username is changed to the value of the ID in
  that field. No default, so not operational in standard demo catalog.
  Enabled with:

        UserDB  default   merged_user  merge_to

  That would look in the database field "merge_to" for a user name
  to change to.

* Added new SourcePriority catalog directive.

* Force re-configure on compile_link --force.

* Fix table editor bug found by Jeff Boes <jeff@endpoint.com> which
  prevented custom widget type from working.

* Shorthand added to allow beginning/ending year with date widget
  name (i.e. yearbegin1934, yearend=0000 where 0000 means current year).

* Add ability to configure the number of levels and hash length for
  the directory structure of file-based sessions. Instead of a fixed
  value of 2 and 1 for levels and length, respectively, make two
  configuration parameters named SessionHashLevels and SessionHashLength

  Default is 2 and 1, respectively, matching the current values.

  This solves the problem of session IDs passed from CGI::Session or other
  modules that use a quasi-sequential session ID. You end up placing all
  sessions in the S/2 directory for a long time, followed by the S/3 directory,
  etc. A setting of:
  
    SessionHashLength   4
    SessionHashLevels   1

  would break sessions up into separate directories instead of putting all
  sessions in a huge directory.

* Encoding and fallback for reading/writing files while in UTF-8 mode.

* New adjust_time() function allows time adjustment based on secs, mins, hours,
  days, weeks, months and years.  Also can string multiple adjustments together
  and compensate for daylight savings time changes over the adjustment period.

* _set_acl() in UserDB.pm now uses adjust_time() instead of time_to_seconds().

* Fix MaxQuantityField to allow a null, blank, or non-numerical entry in the
  field to represent that no maximum quantity should be enforced for that
  product.

* Update broken getppid() detection for Perl 5.10.0.

* Do not specify a default charset if none is passed via MV_HTTP_CHARSET.
  Thanks to Raymond Cheng <rayonnet@hotmail.com> for pointing out the regression
  caused by this.

Payment
-------

* Added PaypalExpress payment module from Lyn St George <info@zolotek.net>.

* Removed long-defunct BoA (Bank of America) payment module. Bank of America
  is a reseller for CyberSource so its module applies:
  http://www.bankofamerica.com/small_business/merchant_card_processing/index.cfm?template=internet_e_commerce

* Removed long-defunct CyberCash payment module.

* Added changes from Bill Carr <bill@bottlenose-wine.com> to
  Business::OnlinePayment to allow extra parameters to be passed.

* [pay-cert] tag now uses the new adjust_time() function instead of the older
  time_to_seconds().

* Remove CVV2 (Card Security Code) from default credit card encrypted block
  template so that it will not even be stored in encrypted form. This makes
  the default behavior compliant with section 3.2.2 of PCI-DSS 1.2:

  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/download.html?id=pci_dss_v1-2.pdf

  It is of course still possible to manually supply a template that stores
  the card security code in violation of PCI-DSS requirements, so developers
  should review any custom credit card encryption templates to make sure that
  the CVV2 is not included, and purge it from any historical data.

* Send correct level 2 card data with AuthorizeNet module. This improves the
  discount rate for a lot of card types.

UserTag
-------

* [run-profile] now accepts ref attribute to check an arbitrary hash.

* Added empty attribute for [convert-date] to display a custom string
  instead of the current date when no proper date is passed.

* [component], [convert-date] and [css] now use the new adjust_time() function
  instead of the older time_to_seconds().

* [convert-date] has a new compensate_dst attribute that when set to 1 will
  compensate the adjusted time for daylight savings time changes.

* Fixed bug in [convert-date] that skewed the time by one hour if the starting
  date was during daylight savings time and an adjustment was made.

* Fixed regression in [convert-date] that caused it to display Sunday for every
  day of the week if a raw date was passed and the adjust attribute was not.
  Thanks to Marty Tennison <marty@dripdepot.com> for reporting the bug.

SystemTag
---------

* The error is now not anymore automatically appended to the output of [error]
  when MV_ERROR_STD_LABEL has a value.

* [time] now uses adjust_time() instead of the older time_to_seconds().  There
  is also a new compensate_dst attribute that when set to 1 will compensate the
  adjusted time for daylight savings time changes.

Filter
------

* Make code/Filter/text2html.filter output valid code.
  Using double <br>'s instead of opening tag <p>.

Checks
------

* Allow custom error messages for email_only check.

* ISBN check can be advised to accept ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 numbers only.

Jobs
----

* Added job group name to error message on missing catalog.

Admin UI
--------

* Check/uncheck all facility for customers/items (#18).

* Allow file removal with uploadhelper widget (#180).

* New user_merge specialsub is run from the [user-merge] tag when two users are
  merged.

Standard demo
-------------

* Correct update of saved company value for shipping address (#125).

* Corrected min/max length for username entry to ship_addresses.html (#114).

* Refurbished standard/pages/quantity.html (#204).

* Added German locale translations (#40).

* Fixed wrong URLs in language selection (#265).

* Removed spurious SQLite database configuration file.

* Removed rarely used mass_setting admininstration page.

* Add company name to shipping and billing addresses and filter output 
  with evalue.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 5.7.1 released 2008-11-13.


Core
----

* Perl 5.8.5 or newer is now required.

* Fixed regression in Vend::Table::DBI::set_slice for the following usage
  pattern (RT #200):

  $Db{table}->set_slice('', %parms));

* Quell bogus warnings from Encode::Alias (#224). Thanks to Andy
  <ic@tvcables.co.uk> and Rene Hertell <icdevgroup@hertell.com>.

* Added Nunavut to the list of valid Canadian provinces (#231). Thanks to
  Mathew Jones for the report.

* Fix vulnerability where a string passed in the mv_order_item CGI variable is
  displayed verbatim without any input sanitation if there is a valid sku in
  mv_sku. Thanks to Mat from Bibliopolis for discovering and reporting the
  vulnerability.

* Refined error message for missing actions.

* Vend::Interpolate::interpolate_html returns undef on undefined input text.
  This allows to determine whether $Tag->include fails or just produces an
  empty string.

* Fixed deficiency in Levies, where multiple handling modes separated by null
  would not work as in the old subtotal calculation model.

* Correct cookie-clearing function in UserDB.

* Extend MaxQuantityField config directive to support fields prefixed with
  '=' or '?'.

  By default, there's no behavior change and specification of
  'MaxQuantityField f1 f2' sets max quantity to f1 + f2.

  With f1 =f2, max quantity is unconditionally set to f2.

  With f1 ?f2, max quantity is set to f2 only if f2 > 0.

  By Cameron B. Prince <cameron@princeinternet.com>.

* Allow SQL EXPLAIN and SHOW along with SELECT, for queries.
  Thanks to Frederic Steinfels.

* Allow explicit manual table exports even when NoExportExternal is enabled,
  using the force option to &Vend::Data::export_database.

* Fixed database typing problem for HIDE_FIELD. Reported by Sonny Cook.

* Support "secure cookies", which are sent only over SSL connections.
  From a patch by Frederic Steinfels <fst@highdefinition.ch>.

* Allow XML posts by e.g. Google Checkout, which broke in Interchange 5.6.0
  (RT #219). By Andy <ic@tvcables.co.uk>.

* Currently the only order cleanup available, i.e., functions to run after all
  data in the session has been used for order functions, is the bottom of the
  receipt page, if you happen to know that is the place to do it.

  Provide the new OrderCleanup catalog directive which takes a routine name
  and is an authoritative place to perform such actions, in the same vein as
  AutoLoad and AutoEnd. Implementation possibilites include profiles to be
  run at the end or a SpecialSub.

* Fixed problem with new-style shipping configuration reading a mixed-case
  option.

* Corrected logic flaw that applied UTF-8 handling in some cases where it
  shouldn't have. Fixed by David Christensen <david@endpoint.com>.

Search
------

* mv_force_coordinate (fc) added to force coordinated search. Normally,
  when the number of search field does not match the number of search
  strings (specs), coordinated mode is automatically turned off. With
  'fc', number of search specs is adjusted to match the number of search
  fields, either by filling the array with last-set mv_searchspec, or by
  trimming excess values. Useful when you want to search for one string in
  multiple fields in coordinated mode.

* Removed trailing whitespace from text file headers.

* Under rare circumstances the missing search can fall through in a block
  below, which caused an internal server error in the following code line:

	$obj->{matches} = scalar @{$obj->{mv_results}};

  This is now mitigated by an empty mv_results array and results in a search
  error as one would expect.

* Refining searches with properties in Swish search:

    sf=distribution
    se=lenny

    se=postgresql

  This also reverts the workaround for #111.

UserTag
-------

* srcliteral attribute added to [button] tag. Setting srcliteral avoids
  the image existence check for the src attribute.

* [run-profile] removes automatically generated profiles only.

* scratch attribute added to [capture-page] to store the resulting page in a
  scratch variable, supplied by Phil Smith.

* lines attribute added to [nitems] to show the number of lines in the shopping
  cart instead of the sum of the items (#225).

* Made [capture-page] aware of mapped output (#197, #226).

* Added name and id to list of [image] pass-through attributes.

* We are vulnerable to cross-site scripting problems any time there is a
  <input value="[value foo]"> call. You can get around this, of course,
  with <input value="[value name=foo keep=1 filter=encode_entities"]">
  instead. That is a bit of a mess, though, so I added an alias for that
  called "evalue".

  You call it with [evalue address1], which is identical to
  [value keep=1 filter="encode_entities" name=address1].

* Make backup-database tag work even when NoExportExternal is enabled.

* Add [set-cookie secure=1] option for SSL-only cookies.

OrderCheck
----------

* Added ISBN-13 support to isbn order check and relocated it to code/OrderCheck.

Filters
-------

* Fixed regression in html2text filter to re-allow paragraph attributes such as
  <p align="center">.

Widgets
-------

* Prevent cross-site scripting problem in the country-select widget. Found and
  fixed by Josh Lavin of Perusion.

Admin UI
--------

* Prevent whitespace leaking into CREDIT_CARDS_ACCEPTED variable (#209).

* Sort customer orders by order date, descending (was arbitrary).
  (By Rene Hertell, RT #203.)

* Someone removed email_copy field from userdb table, which meant that
  email was not sent to customers by default on status updates. Changed
  to default to yes if email_copy field not present in user table.

* Added tracking_number field to order status if field exists in orderline,
  and handle it in update_order_status tag.

Payment
-------

* If the tmp/wget directory (or more properly "$Vend::Cfg->{ScratchDir}/wget")
  directory did not exist, use_wget mode failed. Changed code to make
  directory if non-existent, and give better error if by some strange chance
  a file existed there.

* Authorize.net fixes by Josh Lavin of Perusion:

  Allow mv_transaction_id to be sent when mv_order_number has not yet been
  created (the case with all newer catalogs, as they use tid.counter).

  Allow Business Checking type of 'CCD' (defaults to WEB if not set or sent).

Standard demo
-------------

* Added SQLite support.
 
* Disabled product comment to prevent spam showing up on default installations.

* Provide reasonable defaults for shipping mode and country at checkout to avoid
  "not enough information" errors.

* Increased default length of orderline.order_number to 24.

* Modified include/checkout forms to use evalue. There are undoubtedly many
  other places it should be put in. But until this is evaluated properly I
  don't want to do it all over the place. You can do so with this one liner,
  at least pretty reliably:

     perl -pi -e 's{value="\[(value\s+[-\w]+\])}{value="[e$1}g'

  I think we have gotten rid of all VALUE= uppercase kind of things,
  but if not we should now.

Packaging
---------

* Numerous Debian packaging and localization updates.

* Modernize RPM packaging:

  Bundled version of HTML::Entities has been removed, so don't look for it.

  Update syntax used for chown and find.

  Install all man pages to section 8, so the man page for Interchange's
  crontab script doesn't conflict with the system crontab program, and since
  Interchange's "binaries" aren't typically in PATH anyway.

  Stop using deprecated RPM PreReq tag.

  Explicitly require Safe::Hole and Set::Crontab, which the RPM dependency
  checker misses.

  Force use of /usr/lib, not /usr/lib64, on x86_64. We're not installing
  binaries (except the cgi-bin which is in /var/www anyway) and many things
  depend on the /usr/lib location.

  Require Perl 5.8.8 or newer for build and installation to be compatible
  with system threaded Perl.

  Use interchange-* helper scripts directly from SPECS/ in source tarball,
  instead of copying. Enables use of rpmbuild -ta directly on tarball.

  Don't check for IniConf.pm anymore as it's part of dist/lib now.

Interchange 5.7.0 never formally released.
